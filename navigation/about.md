Creator of Student 2025

My name is Ehren Leon

<p>I took this class beause of my love for computers and games, I grew up watching movies that had to do with coding and I really found it cool that most of todays things was made from random numbers and words.
Im going to work the hardest in this class because this is like a life skill to me because I plan on using it in the future, like small prjects or maybe even engineering, websites and maybe game making. &#128189;</p>
