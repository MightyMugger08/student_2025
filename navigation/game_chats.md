On my journey to making this clone of the github page is going into my computers terminal and downloading linx and ubuntu.
I did get confused halfway through setting up my terminal so I had to go and back track through the knighthawk coders link and re checking the instructions over and over until i found where i got confused, after finding where I had left off I copy and pasted the scripts. I made sure to edit in and creat my username and account for the project and then fully copy the nighthawk website into my own on a seperate coding terminal called visual studio code. I then had to go into configs, then navigation and finally rewritting a code to create this page in this website.
